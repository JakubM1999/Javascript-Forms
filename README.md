<p> In this assignment I used components from my design system assignment I created registration form that outputs errors and successes when you click on the submit button.
I feel like I learned alot, I maneged to make a form with couple of data types and even password validation that means that you have to have: one uppercase, one number etc. So I would say tat I gained the skills and knowledge that was required, but still there is a lot to learn however this my start and I did my best. :)</p>
<p> Hope that everything is okay. </p>
